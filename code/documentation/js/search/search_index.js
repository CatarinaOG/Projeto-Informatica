generated using JHipster 7.9.4, you can find documentation and help at https://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v7.9.4.\nProject Structure\nNode is required for generation and recommended for development. package.json is always generated for a better development experience with prettier, commit hooks, scripts and so on.\nIn the project root, JHipster generates configuration files for tools like git, prettier, eslint, husky, and others that are well known and you can find references in the web.\n/src/* structure follows default Java structure.\n\n.yo-rc.json - Yeoman configuration file\nJHipster configuration is stored in this file at generator-jhipster key. You may find generator-jhipster-* for specific blueprints configuration.\n\n.yo-resolve (optional) - Yeoman conflict resolver\nAllows to use a specific action when conflicts are found skipping prompts for files that matches a pattern. Each line should match [pattern] [action] with pattern been a Minimatch pattern and action been one of skip (default if ommited) or force. Lines starting with # are considered comments and are ignored.\n\n.jhipster/*.json - JHipster entity configuration files\n\nnpmw - wrapper to use locally installed npm.\nJHipster installs Node and npm locally using the build tool by default. This wrapper makes sure npm is installed locally and uses it avoiding some differences different versions can cause. By using ./npmw instead of the traditional npm you can configure a Node-less environment to develop or test your application.\n\n/src/main/docker - Docker configurations for the application and services that the application depends on\n\n\nDevelopment\nBefore you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:\n\nNode.js: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.\nDepending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.\n\nAfter installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.\nYou will only need to run this command when dependencies change in package.json.\nExample :npm installWe use npm scripts and Angular CLI with Webpack as our build system.\nRun the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser\nauto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.\nExample :./mvnw\nnpm startNpm is also used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by\nspecifying a newer version in package.json. You can also run npm update and npm install to manage dependencies.\nAdd the help flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, npm help update.\nThe npm run command will list all of the scripts available to run for this project.\nPWA Support\nJHipster ships with PWA (Progressive Web App) support, and it's turned off by default. One of the main components of a PWA is a service worker.\nThe service worker initialization code is disabled by default. To enable it, uncomment the following code in src/main/webapp/app/app.module.ts:\nExample :ServiceWorkerModule.register('ngsw-worker.js', { enabled: false }),Managing dependencies\nFor example, to add Leaflet library as a runtime dependency of your application, you would run following command:\nExample :npm install --save --save-exact leafletTo benefit from TypeScript type definitions from DefinitelyTyped repository in development, you would run following command:\nExample :npm install --save-dev --save-exact @types/leafletThen you would import the JS and CSS files specified in library's installation instructions so that Webpack knows about them:\nEdit src/main/webapp/app/app.module.ts file:\nExample :import 'leaflet/dist/leaflet.js';Edit src/main/webapp/content/scss/vendor.scss file:\nExample :@import '~leaflet/dist/leaflet.css';Note: There are still a few other things remaining to do for Leaflet that we won't detail here.\nFor further instructions on how to develop with JHipster, have a look at Using JHipster in development.\nUsing Angular CLI\nYou can also use Angular CLI to generate some custom client code.\nFor example, the following command:\nExample :ng generate component my-componentwill generate few files:\nExample :create src/main/webapp/app/my-component/my-component.component.html\ncreate src/main/webapp/app/my-component/my-component.component.ts\nupdate src/main/webapp/app/app.module.tsJHipster Control Center\nJHipster Control Center can help you manage and control your application(s). You can start a local control center server (accessible on http://localhost:7419) with:\nExample :docker-compose -f src/main/docker/jhipster-control-center.yml upBuilding for production\nPackaging as jar\nTo build the final jar and optimize the diabo application for production, run:\nExample :./mvnw -Pprod clean verifyThis will concatenate and minify the client CSS and JavaScript files. It will also modify index.html so it references these new files.\nTo ensure everything worked, run:\nExample :java -jar target/*.jarThen navigate to http://localhost:8080 in your browser.\nRefer to Using JHipster in production for more details.\nPackaging as war\nTo package your application as a war in order to deploy it to an application server, run:\nExample :./mvnw -Pprod,war clean verifyTesting\nTo launch your application's tests, run:\nExample :./mvnw verifyClient tests\nUnit tests are run by Jest. They're located in src/test/javascript/ and can be run with:\nExample :npm testFor more information, refer to the Running tests page.\nCode quality\nSonar is used to analyse code quality. You can start a local Sonar server (accessible on http://localhost:9001) with:\nExample :docker-compose -f src/main/docker/sonar.yml up -dNote: we have turned off authentication in src/main/docker/sonar.yml for out of the box experience while trying out SonarQube, for real use cases turn it back on.\nYou can run a Sonar analysis with using the sonar-scanner or by using the maven plugin.\nThen, run a Sonar analysis:\nExample :./mvnw -Pprod clean verify sonar:sonarIf you need to re-run the Sonar phase, please be sure to specify at least the initialize phase since Sonar properties are loaded from the sonar-project.properties file.\nExample :./mvnw initialize sonar:sonarFor more information, refer to the Code quality page.\nUsing Docker to simplify development (optional)\nYou can use Docker to improve your JHipster development experience. A number of docker-compose configuration are available in the src/main/docker folder to launch required third party services.\nFor example, to start a oracle database in a docker container, run:\nExample :docker-compose -f src/main/docker/oracle.yml up -dTo stop it and remove the container, run:\nExample :docker-compose -f src/main/docker/oracle.yml downYou can also fully dockerize your application and all the services that it depends on.\nTo achieve this, first build a docker image of your app by running:\nExample :npm run java:dockerOr build a arm64 docker image when using an arm64 processor os like MacOS with M1 processor family running:\nExample :npm run java:docker:arm64Then run:\nExample :docker-compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up -dWhen running Docker Desktop on MacOS Big Sur or later, consider enabling experimental Use the new Virtualization framework for better processing performance (disk access performance is worse).\nFor more information refer to Using Docker and Docker-Compose, this page also contains information on the docker-compose sub-generator (jhipster docker-compose), which is able to generate docker configurations for one or several JHipster applications.\nContinuous Integration (optional)\nTo configure CI for your project, run the ci-cd sub-generator (jhipster ci-cd), this will let you generate configuration files for a number of Continuous Integration systems. Consult the Setting up Continuous Integration page for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n
